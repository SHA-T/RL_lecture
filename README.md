# Lecture on Reinforcement Learning

... at the Leibniz University Hannover.

## Credits

The slides for this lecture were created by [Marius Lindauer](https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/en/staff/lindauer/). Part of the material is strongly inspired by Emma Brunskill (CS234 at Stanford; 2019-2020). Many thanks to Emma for agreeing that we can use her material. A previous iteration of this lecture was also inspired by the material from David Silver (at UCL 2015) -- thanks also to him for giving permissions.
