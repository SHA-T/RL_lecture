\begin{frame}[c]{Can We Generalize beyond a given MDP?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What happens if the environment changes? (non-stationary environments)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can we efficiently adapt our policy to changed transitions or reward functions?
		\end{itemize}
		\smallskip
		\item After a human player learned how to play Super Mario Bros in the first levels, they will also play fairly well the upcoming levels.
		\item However, an RL agent potentially will fail.
		\item[$\leadsto$] Strong limitations regarding the applications of a trained agent
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Main Ideas}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Can we use easy environments to learn how to behave in hard environments?
		\pause
		\item Can we train a policy that is easily adaptable to new environments?
		\pause
		\item Can we find better training dynamics across a set of environments?
		\pause
		\item Can we train a policy that generalizes to new environments without any new training?
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assumption: We sample our environments i.i.d. from a fixed distribution
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Similar to the assumption in supervised learning, but on a meta-level
			\item Training environments to train our agent on and test environments to check how well it performs.
			\item We might have control how we sample from this distribution;\\ we might don't.
		\end{itemize}
